Documentation for [JSWAP](https://github.com/deconvolution/JSWAP)

The main target of JSWAP is to provide an easy-to-use parallelization finite-difference wavefield simulation in heterogenous media. As all of the dependencies have been added to JSWAP, it is easy to install and deploy in another computer, even to clusters. The tutorial gives details for the input, output, utilities and structure of the package.
